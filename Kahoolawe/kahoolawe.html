                <p>Military use</p>
                <p>During World War II, Kahoolawe was used as a bombing range by the U.S. Military. 
                    In May 1941, the U.S. Army leased a section of the island for military training for just 
                    $1.00 a year. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the military took control of the entire island. 
                    The island served as a training ground for combined arms operations, involving ships, aircraft, and 
                    ground troops. Kahoolawes military use continued until 1990, after which efforts began to restore the 
                    island and preserve its cultural significance.</p>

                <p>Kahoolawe Island Reserve</p>
                <p>Kahoolawe Island Reserve, located in Hawaii, is a sacred and culturally significant site for Native Hawaiians. 
                    Formerly used as a bombing range by the U.S. military, the island is now managed by the Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve 
                    Commission with a focus on restoration and preservation. Access to the island is restricted, primarily reserved 
                    for native Hawaiian cultural, spiritual, and subsistence purposes. Volunteers can participate in restoration 
                    efforts through organized work trips, contributing to the reestablishment of native flora and the removal of 
                    invasive species. The reserve encompasses several named peaks, with Pu’u Moa’ulanui being the highest, reflecting 
                    the islands unique ecological and geological features.</p>

                <p>Lua Makika</p>
                <p>Lua Makika is the highest point on Kahoolawe, an island in Hawaii, reaching approximately 1,477 feet (450 meters) 
                    above sea level. It is the crater at the summit of Puu Moaulanui, part of an extinct shield volcano that formed 
                    during the Pleistocene epoch. Kahoolawe, where Lua Makika is located, is the smallest of the eight main volcanic 
                    islands in the Hawaiian Islands and has no permanent residents. The islands low elevation and position in the rain 
                    shadow of Mauis Haleakalā Volcano result in a dry climate with less than 26 inches of annual rainfall. Historically 
                    used for military training and bombing practice, Kahoolawe is now designated for native Hawaiian cultural, spiritual, 
                    and subsistence purposes only.</p>

                <p>Environment on Kahoolawe</p>
                <p>Historically, Kahoolawe was a dry forest with intermittent streams, but human activities and overgrazing transformed it
                    into a savanna. The island is notoriously dry, recieving less than 26 inches of rain anually, partly due to its position 
                    in the rain shadow of Mauis Haleakala volcano. Ecological restoration efforts are underway, focusing on controlling erosion 
                    and replanting native species to combat the severe degradation from past military bombings and overgrazing. Innovative 
                    conservation technology using AI-equipped camera traps and drones is being tested to tackle invasive species, like 
                    feral cats, that threaten native seabird populations. The ongoing conservation efforts on Kahoolawe highlight a proactive 
                    approach to restoring its delicate ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of controlling erosion, replanting native species, 
                    and combatting invasive threats like feral cats to preserve the island's natural heritage for future generations.</p>

                <p>Cultural Significance Importance</p>
                <p> Kahoolawe holds a profound cultural significance for Native Hawaiians as a sacred place for celestial 
                    navigation, a vital fishing ground, and a site for cultural and religious rituals. It was historically 
                    used for celestial navigation training, agriculture, and spiritual practices, reflecting the deep connection 
                    between the Hawaiian people and their land. The island became a symbol of resistance and cultural renaissance 
                    when the Protect Kahoolawe Ohana (PKO) led protests against military bombings, which ceased in 1990. Kahoolawe 
                    is at the heart of the Hawaiian Island chain, with specific locations like Kealaikahiki and Moaulaiki being crucial 
                    for traditional navigation and understanding wind patterns and stars. Today, efforts are ongoing to restore the 
                    islands ecosystem and preserve its cultural heritage, making it a testament to resilience and the importance of 
                    safeguarding sacred spaces</p>
