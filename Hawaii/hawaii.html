            <p>Waipio (or Waipio) Valley is named after the meandering Wailoa Stream that runs through the valley (wai-pio means curved water in the Hawaiian language) 
                and is about one mile wide and six miles deep. Towards the back the valley splits into many "fingers", each one with its own waterfall. The valley meets 
                the ocean towards the north with a beautiful black sand beach that is cut in two by the river. <strong> Important Notice </strong>- Waipio Valley Road is closed to non-residents. 
                Visitor access to the valley floor and the subsequent valleys is only possible as part of a tour. The Waipio Lookout is still accessible for everyone</p>
