                    <p>Niihau, often referred to as the “Forbidden Island” of Hawaii, has very restricted access for tourists. 
                        Generally, no one is allowed to visit without an invitation from the islands owners, the Robinson family, or 
                        by one of its 70 full-time Native Hawaiian residents. However, there are some exceptions for those who book a 
                        tour through the owners companies, Niihau Helicopters and Niihau Safaris.

                        These tours offer a rare glimpse into the island, with opportunities for beachcombing, swimming, snorkeling, 
                        and even hunting safaris for the more adventurous. The helicopter tours provide a half-day excursion to a 
                        secluded beach on Niihau, but the rest of the island remains off-limits to preserve the traditional Hawaiian 
                        culture and language.
                        
                        So, while direct travel to Niihau is not possible for the general public, these guided tours are the only way for 
                        tourists to experience a part of the island legally and respectfully</p>
                    <p>Since not everybody can visit this place, here are some facts about Niihau below:</p>

                <p>Niihau, often referred to as the “Forbidden Island” in Hawaii, was purchased by Elizabeth McHutcheson 
                    Sinclair, a Scottish homemaker, farmer, and plantation owner. She bought the island in 1864 from King 
                    Kamehameha V for $10,000. Her descendants, the Robinson family, continue to own and maintain the island 
                    to this day. Elizabeth Sinclairs acquisition of Niihau is notable for her commitment to preserving the native 
                    Hawaiian culture, which has been maintained over the years.</p>

                <p>Lake Halalii</p>
                <p>Lake Hālalii is an ephemeral lake that becomes the largest lake in the Hawaiian Islands during the rainy season. 
                    With a catchment area of about 840.7 acres, it can expand to 860 acres according to some sources. 
                    The lakes water level is irregular, often transforming into a dry, reddish flat with small saline lakes during 
                    dry periods. It is named after either a Hawaiian high chief or the Oahu trickster god Hālalii, and is also known 
                    for its traditional use by Native Hawaiians for weaving Makaloa mats from the Makaloa sedge growing along its shore. 
                    Additionally, Lake Hālalii provides natural wetland habitats for native bird species and is used for mullet farming, 
                    where fish are caught when the water recedes in the summer.</p>

                <p>Niihau spans 69.5 square miles (180 km²) and lies 17.5 miles (28.2 km) southwest of Kauai across the Kaulakahi 
                    Channel. The islands geography is characterized by its arid lowland and a maximum elevation of 1,280 feet (390 m) at 
                    Mount Pānīau. Niihaus dimensions are approximately 6.2 miles by 18.6 miles (10 km x 30 km), and it is privately 
                    owned, with access highly restricted. Despite its small size, the island plays a significant role in preserving native

                <p>Niihau is known for its limited access to outsiders and its commitment to preserving traditional Hawaiian 
                    culture. The island is home to approximately 70 full-time residents, who live a lifestyle that is 
                    largely self-sufficient and closely tied to the land. There are no paved roads, hospitals, police stations, 
                    grocery stores, or indoor plumbing on the island. The residents rely on rainwater catchment systems for water 
                    and use solar panels for electricity. They sustain themselves through hunting, fishing, and farming.</p>

                <p>Niihau Incident 1941</p>
                <p>The Niihau Incident unfolded from December 7 to 13, 1941, when Shigenori Nishikaichi, a pilot from the 
                    Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, crash-landed on Hawaii’s Niihau Island after the Pearl Harbor attack. 
                    Believing Niihau was uninhabited, the Japanese had designated it for emergency landings, but Nishikaichi was 
                    captured by the local Hawaiians, who were initially unaware of the attack. Nishikaichi enlisted the help of 
                    local Japanese residents, the Haradas, leading to a struggle where he and Yoshio Harada died, and Ben Kanahele
                    was injured. The incident highlighted the potential for divided loyalties among Japanese residents in Hawaii 
                    and influenced U.S. policies, including the controversial internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. 
                    The event is a significant but often overlooked moment in American history, demonstrating the complex interplay of war, 
                    culture, and individual actions.</p>
